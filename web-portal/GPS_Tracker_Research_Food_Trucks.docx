## Technical Integration

### API Integration with Your Food Truck App

#### Real-Time Location Updates
```javascript
// Example API integration
const getTruckLocation = async (truckId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${LIGHTNING_GPS_API}/vehicles/${truckId}/location`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
  });
  return response.json();
};

// Update customer-facing location
app.get('/api/foodtrucks/:id/location', async (req, res) => {
  const gpsLocation = await getTruckLocation(req.params.id);
  res.json({
    latitude: gpsLocation.lat,
    longitude: gpsLocation.lng,
    lastUpdated: gpsLocation.timestamp,
    isOpen: await checkBusinessHours(req.params.id)
  });
});
```

#### Business Hours Optimization
Configure different update frequencies:
- **Business Hours**: 30-60 second updates
